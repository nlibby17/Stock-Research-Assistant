# Step 2 — Data Hardening

Step 2 strengthens data identity, provenance, availability dates, and provider
reliability before the application adds historical attribution or backtesting.
Yahoo remains the production source for prices and summary fundamentals. SEC EDGAR
supplies primary-source evidence and isolated calculations; it does not become a
ranking source without a separately approved Step 2.4C promotion. Keeping Yahoo
inputs unchanged is the current decision.

## Milestones

1. **2.1 SEC identity and connection foundation — complete**
   - declared user agent, SEC-host HTTPS restriction, conservative throttling;
   - retries, bounded stale fallback, atomic runtime cache;
   - ticker/CIK/exchange mapping, universe coverage, persisted provider health.
2. **2.2 Filing and availability-date tracking — complete**
   - recent and paginated historical submissions metadata;
   - 10-K, 10-Q, and amendment preservation and point-in-time effective selection;
   - raw acceptance strings plus SEC-Eastern-to-UTC normalization;
   - reporting periods, filing dates, accession and primary-document URLs;
   - active/inactive records for post-acceptance corrections or removals;
   - audited predecessor-CIK continuity for corporate reorganizations;
   - full-universe sync health, coverage, CLI status, report and dashboard links.
3. **2.3 Company Facts normalization — complete**
   - explicit, versioned XBRL concept aliases and expected units;
   - exact decimal values, instant/duration periods, fiscal labels and frames;
   - accession joins to Step 2.2 filing-availability timestamps;
   - deterministic duplicate rejection, restatement selection, and missing values;
   - five-year normalized storage, provider health, CLI and dashboard coverage.
4. **2.4 SEC metric derivation and controlled provider promotion — in progress**
   - **2.4A — complete:** point-in-time annual, quarterly, YTD, and TTM financial
     snapshots with explicit local formulas and metric lineage;
   - **2.4B — in progress (per-runtime evidence gate):** SEC/Yahoo shadow comparison
     across at least three separate underlying market-data dates, with no production-ranking
     changes;
   - **2.4C:** reviewed precedence/fallback rules, before/after ranking comparison,
     and explicit user approval before promotion to a new model version.
5. **2.5 Versioned universe proposals**
   - next proposed product feature under the reduced active plan; discovery runs
     weekly when due during user-started `morning`, not a background scheduler;
   - listing/CIK joins, eligibility checks, corporate-action handling, and dated
     proposed universe versions;
   - proposals are never activated automatically and never rewrite prior runs.

Each milestone ends with deterministic tests, a live validation where applicable,
documentation, and a separately reviewable commit.

The authoritative acceptance gates, reasoning recommendations, and Steps 3–5 are
defined in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Step 2.4 must follow 2.4A → 2.4B → 2.4C;
raw Company Facts must never be substituted directly into production rankings.

## Step 2.1 operational command

```powershell
stockrank sec-health
stockrank sec-health --force
```

The default command uses a fresh identity cache when available. `--force` makes
an explicit live request. Both commands compare SEC identities with the configured
universe and save the latest health result for the dashboard. Neither command
changes the universe or ranking.

## Step 2.2 operational commands

```powershell
stockrank sec-filings-sync
stockrank sec-filings-sync --force
stockrank sec-filings-sync --ticker NVDA
stockrank sec-filings-status
```

The configured default retains five years of normalized 10-K/10-Q metadata.
Additional SEC history pages are requested only when their published date ranges
intersect that window. A successful sync reconciles records in the window so later
SEC corrections or removals become inactive rather than being silently deleted.

Amendments remain independent source records. For a point-in-time view, the
effective selector chooses the latest filing available for the same base form and
reporting period. If an SEC acceptance timestamp is missing, availability falls
back to the filing date with date-only precision rather than inventing a time.

## Step 2.3 operational commands

```powershell
stockrank sec-facts-sync
stockrank sec-facts-sync --force
stockrank sec-facts-sync --ticker NVDA
stockrank sec-facts-status
```

The versioned `config/sec_companyfacts.toml` file is the only concept allowlist.
Each canonical field declares whether it is an instant or duration fact, its
accepted units, and ordered taxonomy/tag alternatives. Alternatives represent the
same economic field and are never summed. Exact duplicate contexts are collapsed;
conflicting values for the same concept, filing, unit, and period fail loudly.

Facts join to Step 2.2 by accession number to inherit the filing acceptance time.
A fact without a matching stored filing is labelled with date-only availability.
For the same canonical field, unit, and period, the point-in-time selector chooses
the latest filing available at the requested cutoff, then uses configured concept
priority to resolve aliases from that filing. Missing concepts remain missing.

Step 2.3 does not change ranking values. Step 2.4A now derives isolated financial
snapshots; Step 2.4B compares those values with Yahoo summary fields and records
differences and possible fallback candidates. Production ranking can
change only through the explicit Step 2.4C promotion gate.
Provider health requires the five configured core concepts for every company.
Optional concepts remain visible as coverage counts because fields such as gross
profit, current assets, and conventional debt components are not uniformly reported
or economically comparable across banks, insurers, utilities, and industrial firms.

## Step 2.4A operational commands

```powershell
stockrank sec-financials-build
stockrank sec-financials-build --ticker NVDA
stockrank sec-financials-build --as-of 2026-08-26
stockrank sec-financials-status
```

The build reads only locally stored Company Facts and appends immutable calculation
snapshots. A date-only cutoff means the end of that date in the configured local
timezone. Each metric records its period, exact decimal value, quality state,
formula, missing/invalid reason, and source-fact lineage. The dashboard exposes
coverage and selected values in the Advanced view's disclosure (Data Quality in
the Streamlit fallback), clearly labelled as non-ranking
inputs. Detailed rules and the live acceptance result are documented in
[`STEP_2_4A.md`](STEP_2_4A.md).

## Step 2.4B operational commands

```powershell
stockrank provider-shadow-run
stockrank provider-shadow-run --ticker NVDA
stockrank provider-shadow-status
```

The comparison reads the latest eligible Step 2.4A snapshot and the stored Yahoo
fundamental snapshot for each company, then freezes both sides in separate shadow
tables. Versioned configuration defines field mappings, freshness limits, period
alignment notes, and strict/material tolerances. Promotion evidence must link to a
complete production run covering the exact configured universe (50 stocks by
default) on one consistent underlying market-data date, using the same complete,
currently supported SEC formula contract for every security. Command time and
repeated same-close runs do not advance the count. The implementation and dated
first-run findings are documented in
[`STEP_2_4B.md`](STEP_2_4B.md).
