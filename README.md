A local, research-only application that reviews a customizable universe of U.S.
stocks, ranks them with an interpretable scoring model, and presents the results in
a browser dashboard. It does not connect to a broker or place trades.

layout. See [Dashboard](#dashboard) for the current interface.*

## What it does

- Ranks an explicit stock universe using growth, valuation, quality, momentum, and
  risk metrics.
- Shows score composition, data coverage, market context, sector leaders, SEC
  filings, and source-aware research details.
- Compares two eligible top candidates in **Stock Comparison**, with interactive selectors
  and tabs for stored scores, key metrics, and same-report research and sources.
- Uses local SQLite history so reports remain reproducible and comparable.
- Supports personal ranking profiles and custom ticker universes on each computer.
- Runs locally on Windows and macOS with a guided installer and desktop launcher.

Scores describe a stock's relative position within the selected universe. They are
not expected returns, investment advice, or a claim that future performance can be
predicted.

## Quick start

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
then open PowerShell on Windows or Terminal on macOS. macOS 11 users should follow
the specific Python requirement in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

```text
git clone https://github.com/nlibby17/Stock-Research-Assistant.git stock-research-assistant
cd stock-research-assistant
```

Run the guided installer:

```powershell
# Windows 10 or 11
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup.ps1
```

```bash
# macOS
bash ./scripts/setup.sh
```

The installer creates a private `.env` file. Add a descriptive application name and
your real email address to `SEC_USER_AGENT`, then run `setup-check` as explained in
[SETUP.md](SETUP.md). The email is identification requested by the SEC, not an API
key or account registration.

## Choose your daily run

For a fast **base report**, accept the installer's recommended desktop launcher and
double-click **Stock Research Assistant**. It runs the deterministic rankings and
opens the dashboard, but it does not perform or import current qualitative research.

You can run the same base-report workflow from the project folder:

```powershell
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\stockrank.exe morning
```

```bash
# macOS
./.venv/bin/stockrank morning
```

For the **full report with qualitative research**, create a Codex or Claude Code
session using this project folder and ask:

> Run my daily report.

The included agent instructions direct it to run the deterministic report, research
the current top candidates, import those notes into the exact report run, validate
the result, and open the dashboard. Allow the agent to run local project commands
and access current web sources when prompted. A different capable coding agent can
use: “Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/DAILY_WORKFLOW.md`, then run my full daily report
and import the qualitative research before opening the dashboard.” No OpenAI or
Anthropic API key is required by this repository; the coding agent is an external
operator chosen by the user.

Keep the terminal window open while using the dashboard. Stop the application with
**Ctrl+C** on Windows or **Control+C (⌃C)** on macOS. The first report takes longer
because it must build the local data cache.

For complete, beginner-friendly installation, running, personalization, and update
instructions, see **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**.

## Dashboard

The dashboard presents the current market context, ranked candidates, score and
coverage breakdowns, three-month sector leaders, qualitative research, SEC filings,
and comparisons with a compatible previous report. All current rankings can be
downloaded as an Excel-friendly CSV.

The React dashboard has five in-place views: **Home**, **Top Candidates**, **Stock
Comparison**, **Research**, and **Advanced**. Use the Home cards or expanding left
navigation. Research shows one numbered company at a time. Charts animate on
entering view, with reduced-motion support. The normal launcher and
`stockrank dashboard` use React; `stockrank dashboard --ui streamlit` opens the
unchanged fallback. End users do not need Node.js: built assets ship with Python.

After stopping the server, an original horizon animation displays **thank you
goodbye**, fits the terminal, and continues until **Y + Enter** at **Close terminal?
[y/n]**. **N + Enter** continues; Ctrl+C also exits the farewell. Unsupported
terminals receive a static version; redirected output never blocks. Y exits the
launcher process. On macOS, the desktop launcher also closes its own single-tab
Apple Terminal window after Y + Enter; manually started commands return to their shell.
See [frontend development and verification](docs/DASHBOARD_REACT.md).

recommendations.*

## Personalization

The default installation uses a balanced profile and an explicit 50-stock universe.
Run `stockrank configure` to choose a growth, value, quality, momentum,
lower-volatility, or balanced profile and to supply your own tickers. Personal files
remain local and are ignored by Git, so different computers can use different
settings safely.

Automatic discovery of a broader stock universe is planned but is not active yet.
The application never silently adds securities to a user's approved universe.

## How it works

1. Yahoo Finance supplies daily prices and summarized screening fundamentals.
2. SEC EDGAR supplies official company identity, filing, and Company Facts data.
3. Tested Python code calculates metrics, coverage, and relative scores.
4. SQLite stores compact caches and immutable run history locally.
5. A loopback-only Python server reads a consistent SQLite snapshot into the React
   dashboard. Streamlit remains available as a fallback.

Missing or stale values remain visible instead of being fabricated. SEC-derived
financial calculations are currently compared with the production provider in an
isolated shadow layer and do not silently alter rankings.

Optional current-news and qualitative research can be completed by a person or any
capable AI agent. The repository does not require an OpenAI API key and is not tied
to Codex.

## Important limitations

Yahoo Finance is convenient but unofficial and does not provide point-in-time
fundamentals suitable for a valid historical fundamental backtest. Some companies
also have sparse price, fundamental, or SEC coverage. The application reports those
limitations and keeps data coverage separate from score.

Runtime databases, caches, reports, logs, personal configuration, and `.env` are
stored locally and excluded from Git.
