# Install and Run Stock Research Assistant

This guide sets up a separate local copy of the application. Reports, caches,
personal settings, and database history stay on that computer and are not downloaded
from GitHub.

## 1. Install Git and Python

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Then install the appropriate Python
version:

- **Windows 10 or 11:** [Python 3.11 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
- **macOS 12 or newer:** a [current Python 3 release](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/).
- **macOS 11:** the official
  [Python 3.12.10 universal2 installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31210/).
  Python 3.12 can safely exist beside another Python version.

On Windows, allow the Python installer to add Python to `PATH` if that option is
shown.

## 2. Download the project

Open PowerShell on Windows or Terminal on macOS. Run these commands:

```text
git clone https://github.com/nlibby17/Stock-Research-Assistant.git stock-research-assistant
cd stock-research-assistant
```

The second command places the terminal inside the newly downloaded project folder.

## 3. Run the guided setup

### Windows 10 or 11

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup.ps1
```

### macOS

```bash
bash ./scripts/setup.sh
```

Setup creates the local Python environment, installs the application, and creates a
private `.env` file without overwriting an existing one. When asked about the
recommended desktop shortcut or launcher, press **Enter** or **Return** for Yes.

The macOS helper automatically uses Python 3.12 and compatible prebuilt packages on
macOS 11. It avoids the PyArrow/libcst compilation and segmentation-fault problems
seen with incompatible versions on that operating system.

## 4. Add the SEC contact identity

Open `.env`:

```powershell
# Windows
notepad .env
```

```bash
# macOS
open -e .env
```

Find `SEC_USER_AGENT` and replace its placeholder with a descriptive application
name and a real contact email, for example:

```text
SEC_USER_AGENT="Personal Stock Research Assistant name@example.com"
```

Save and close the file. This identifies automated requests to the SEC; it is not
an API key, password, mailing-list signup, or brokerage credential.

## 5. Check the installation

```powershell
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\stockrank.exe setup-check
```

```bash
# macOS
./.venv/bin/stockrank setup-check
```

Continue when the check reports that setup is ready.

## 6. Run the application

Choose either a base report or an agent-assisted report. Both use the same tested
financial calculations and local history; the difference is whether current-source
qualitative research is added to that run.

### Option A: base report without qualitative research

The easiest method is to double-click **Stock Research Assistant** on the desktop.
It runs the deterministic rankings and opens the dashboard in the default browser.
The launcher does not contact an AI service, research current news, or populate the
new run's qualitative-research fields.

If you did not create the desktop item, run the appropriate command from the project
folder:

```powershell
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\stockrank.exe morning
```

```bash
# macOS
./.venv/bin/stockrank morning
```

### Option B: full report with agent-assisted qualitative research

Open Codex or Claude Code, create a coding session with this project folder, and ask:

> Run my daily report.

The included project instructions tell the agent to run the deterministic report,
research the current top candidates using dated sources, import the research into
the exact report run, validate it, and then open the dashboard. Approve access to
local project commands and current web sources when the agent requests it.

For another capable coding agent, use this fuller prompt:

> Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/DAILY_WORKFLOW.md`, then run my full daily report and
> import the qualitative research before opening the dashboard.

The application is not tied to Codex or Claude Code, and the repository itself does
not require an OpenAI or Anthropic API key. The selected agent must be capable of
using local tools, researching current sources, and following the import validation.

The first report may take several minutes while the local SEC and market-data cache
is created. Later reports normally reuse safe cached data and finish faster.

Keep the terminal window open while using the dashboard. To stop the application,
return to that window and press:

- **Windows:** Ctrl+C
- **macOS:** Control+C (⌃C)

Closing only the browser tab does not stop the local dashboard server.

After shutdown, a blue-to-white horizon animation displays **thank you goodbye**
and automatically fits the terminal. At **Close terminal? [y/n]**, type **Y** and
press **Enter/Return** to exit, or **N** and Enter/Return to keep it running. Your
typed choice is visible; Ctrl+C also exits the animation. There is no second
success confirmation. A manually started command returns to its existing shell;
the macOS desktop launcher closes its own single-tab Apple Terminal window after
Y + Return. If macOS requests permission to control Terminal, allow it for automatic
closing. Windows containing additional tabs are left open to preserve other sessions.
Unsupported terminals use a static farewell; redirected output never waits.

### Open the existing report without a new run

```powershell
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\stockrank.exe dashboard
```

```bash
# macOS
./.venv/bin/stockrank dashboard
```

The default React dashboard uses the latest stored report. Reload the browser
after generating a new report or importing research. Normal installation and
updates include the built interface: no Node.js or frontend build is needed.
Append `--ui streamlit` to the platform's dashboard command for the retained
Streamlit fallback. See [dashboard details](docs/DASHBOARD_REACT.md).

## Create or repair the desktop launcher

Run the appropriate helper from the project folder:

```powershell
# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install-launcher.ps1
```

```bash
# macOS
bash ./scripts/install-launcher.sh
```

The desktop item points to the launcher retained inside the project. Normal updates
therefore take effect automatically. If the project folder is moved or renamed,
rerun this helper.

## Personalize the rankings and stock universe

Personalization is optional. The default balanced profile and curated 50-stock
universe work immediately.

Start the guided configuration:

```powershell
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\stockrank.exe configure
```

```bash
# macOS
./.venv/bin/stockrank configure
```

The guide lets you select a balanced, growth, value, quality, momentum, or
lower-volatility profile; adjust horizon and risk preferences; and keep or replace
the stock universe. It shows the resulting weights before saving.

To paste a custom list directly:

```powershell
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\stockrank.exe configure --tickers "MSFT,JPM,PLTR,SOFI"
```

```bash
# macOS
./.venv/bin/stockrank configure --tickers "MSFT,JPM,PLTR,SOFI"
```

To import a CSV, provide a `ticker` column and optional `company` and `sector`
columns:

```powershell
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\stockrank.exe configure --universe-file .\my-stocks.csv
```

```bash
# macOS
./.venv/bin/stockrank configure --universe-file ./my-stocks.csv
```

Personal settings are saved as ignored `config/*.local.*` files and never change
another user's installation. After changing them, run the platform's `stockrank
config-check` executable; add `--live` before the first report with a new universe.
Use `stockrank configure --reset` with the same platform-specific executable to
restore all defaults.

## Update an existing installation

Stop the application, open the project folder in PowerShell or Terminal, and run:

```powershell
# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\update.ps1
```

```bash
# macOS
bash ./scripts/update.sh
```

The updater safely downloads project changes, synchronizes dependencies, validates
the installation and personal configuration, and runs the tests. It preserves
`.env`, local preferences, the custom universe, and ignored `runtime/` history.

Relaunch the desktop item after updating; an already-running process still uses
its previously loaded code. On Windows the launcher opens a dedicated Python
console so Ctrl+C does not trigger an extra batch-file termination question.

## Useful troubleshooting

- **The desktop item stopped working after moving the folder:** rerun the launcher
  helper above.
- **The browser did not open:** use the local URL printed in the terminal, normally
  `http://localhost:8765`.
- **The port is already in use:** stop the earlier dashboard terminal with Ctrl+C or
  Control+C, then try again.
- **The launcher says the local environment is missing:** rerun the guided setup.
- **The SEC identity check fails:** reopen `.env`, confirm that the placeholder was
  replaced, save it, and rerun `setup-check`.
- **macOS blocks the launcher:** Control-click it, choose **Open**, and confirm once.

workflow, see [docs/DAILY_WORKFLOW.md](docs/DAILY_WORKFLOW.md). For architecture and
data-policy details, see [docs/V1_DESIGN.md](docs/V1_DESIGN.md).

## Advanced notes

Experienced users may provide the SEC identity during setup with `-SecUserAgent` on
Windows or `--sec-user-agent` on macOS. Unattended setup can explicitly choose the
desktop item with `-CreateDesktopShortcut`/`-SkipDesktopShortcut` on Windows or
`--desktop-launcher`/`--no-desktop-launcher` on macOS.

Linux users can create `.venv`, install the project with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`,
copy `.env.example` to `.env`, and use `.venv/bin/stockrank` commands. Linux does not
currently have a guided desktop launcher.

To migrate report history between computers, stop the application and copy the
ignored `runtime/` directory separately. Never commit `.env` or `runtime/`.
