# Repository Guidance for AI Agents

Read `README.md`, `docs/DAILY_WORKFLOW.md`, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` before operating or
changing this project. Follow the roadmap sequence and acceptance gates. Preserve
unrelated user changes and inspect `git status` before editing.

For dashboard or launcher work, also read `docs/DASHBOARD_REACT.md`. React is the
default local dashboard; Streamlit is an explicit fallback. Current delivery status
and the next-session starting point are at the top of `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

When a user asks to run a daily report, morning analysis, or equivalent full
research workflow, read `CODEX.md` and follow its two-part completion contract. Do
not stop after generating or previewing a separate research Markdown file. The
generated `runtime/reports/research_template.json` must be completed, imported into
the same analysis run, and confirmed by `stockrank validate-latest` before the
dashboard is presented as the completed AI-assisted report.

Before assessing or implementing structural refactoring, also read
`docs/REFACTORING_REVIEW.md`. Treat it as the authoritative proposal and decision
ledger, and do not begin production refactoring until its review and approval gates
are complete.

Use `stockrank config-check` to inspect the effective per-computer profile and
universe. Personal files under `config/*.local.*` are private local state: preserve
them, never stage them, and do not assume another clone uses the same settings.

All deterministic financial calculations belong in tested Python code. AI-assisted
work is limited to current-source qualitative research and must keep facts,
calculations, expectations, interpretation, and speculation clearly separated.
Never substitute demo data for live data, conceal stale or missing values, connect
to a broker, place trades, or portray a ranking as certainty.

Run relevant tests and verify that `.env`, `runtime/`, databases, caches, reports,
logs, and secrets are not staged before any user-authorized commit.
